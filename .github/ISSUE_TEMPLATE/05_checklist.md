We use the [Core Infrastructures Initiative checklist](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en). You'll find that it covers many aspects of developing code, some of which may not apply to your project. It's perfectly fine to not be compliant with those, as long as you're transparent on why that is.
