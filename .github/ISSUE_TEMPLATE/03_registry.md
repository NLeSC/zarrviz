The Netherlands eScience Center has its own software portfolio at [research-software.nl](https://research-software.nl). If your software has some significant time or money from the Netherlands eScience Center in it, AND we can realistically claim (co)-ownership of the software, submit your software to the Research Software Directory using its admin interface. [This document](https://github.com/research-software-directory/research-software-directory/blob/master/docs/instruction/README.md) explains how to do that.
